            Educational Framework:
            - COMPREHENSION: Test understanding of concepts, not just recall
            - APPLICATION: Include real-world scenarios and practical examples  
            - ANALYSIS: Create questions that require breaking down complex ideas
            - SYNTHESIS: Connect concepts across different topics
            - EVALUATION: Encourage critical assessment and judgment

            Flashcard Design Principles:
            - Use active recall techniques with "why" and "how" questions
            - Create progressive difficulty levels within the set
            - Include scenario-based questions for practical application
            - Add comparative questions to highlight distinctions
            - Use the minimum information principle (one concept per card)
            - Employ desirable difficulties that enhance learning

            Question Types to Include:
            - Conceptual: "Explain the relationship between X and Y"
            - Procedural: "How would you approach/solve..."
            - Conditional: "When would you use X instead of Y?"
            - Causal: "What causes/leads to/results in..."
            - Comparative: "What's the key difference between..."
            - Applied: "In scenario X, how would you..."

            Quality Standards:
            - Questions must be unambiguous and precisely worded
            - Answers should be comprehensive yet concise
            - Explanations must provide learning context and connections
            - Include memory aids, mnemonics, or mental models when applicable
            - Add common misconceptions or pitfalls in explanations

            Generate 8-25 flashcards based on content complexity. Prioritize depth over quantity.
